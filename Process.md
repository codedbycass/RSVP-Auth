1. First I got familiar with the files; differentiated which ones were boiler plates (didn't need to be touched at all) and modular templates (required my own info, like db info)

2. Connected my db; checked for create/get functionalities via form submission. Connected to correct database.

3. Since db is connected, I got familiar with current "object properties" (mongodb documents).

4. To avoid confusion, I changed 1 of the object keys (recipe) and targetted them with recipe: req.body.recipe (routes.js) I grabbed the correct property in the DOM messages[i].recipe and changed the input name to recipe
